      <h1>Stand United Against Hate | 2021</h1>
      <h2>Digital Illustration, Illustrator</h2>
      <p>I created this visual to bring awareness to anti-Asian violence and hate in response to the multiple hate crimes that have taken place over the past year and even long before that. I decided to include quoted parts of incidents reported by victims of anti-Asian hate. I chose to include a few of these reported incidents because I believe that providing a specific, personal experience would have a more effective impact, than just statistics on a poster would. Providing a specific, reported experience to raise awareness often allows people to connect more easily to a person rather than seeing numbers from a macro perspective. Additionally, at the bottom of the visual, I write “Stop the scapegoating. Stop the hate. Stop the virus.” The last two phrases are more commonly seen among awareness visuals and texts about anti-Asian hate, but the more specific act of scapegoating them is not necessarily stated. Addressing the act of scapegoating the asian community specifies a major part in how they are being targeted and is something I wanted to specify as a callback to the Vincent Chin case, as the entire case spiraled from scapegoating a part of the asian community. Creating this visual really opened my eyes to just how relevant the past is to the present as history is perpetuating itself. </p>
